# Agile Reading

## Assignment

1. Read the recommended reading
2. Spend some time reading whatever intersets you from the above menu of choices - feel free to go off script and read about anything else tangentially related that you find valuable. If your research takes you to something interesting, send it to your classmates on Slack. Participate in a discussion in slack about any of the topics you've read about (there is a channel called #agile where we can discuss). Remember, participation in discussions on slack is required and will be graded.
3. Write down questions you might have about agile and tech projects in government as you go along. One of our guest speakers will be David Zvenyach, former executive director of 18F who will discuss running agile teams in government.

## Recommended Reading
- [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X) [Chapter 1] (provided)
- [Elements of Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Scrum-Chris-Sims-ebook/dp/B004O0U74Q/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1546492282&sr=1-2&keywords=elements+of+scrum) [Part I and Part II] 
	- (Go ahead and read the whole thing if you find yourself interested, its not too long)

A shorter alternative to "Elements of Scrum"

- [Scrum: A Breathtakingly Breif and Agile Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007P5N8D4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
	- This book essentially repeats the concepts from Elements of Scrum. It would be handy to have a copy of it as a guide for the class. If don't have time to read Elements of Scrum, please at least flip through this book (it's much shorter).

## Other Readings

Do you have burning questions about Scrum? Like "What are the most common pitfals of agile teams?", "How does one write a contract for a software that is built in an agile fashion?", "Which governments are using agile, and how?". Please spend some time researching your burning questions, or whatever it is about this topic that most interests you. Here are a few places you could start, but please feel free to go off script.
