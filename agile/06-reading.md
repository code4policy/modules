## Additional Resources

A shorter alternative to "Elements of Scrum" (in case you run out of time)

- [Scrum: A Breathtakingly Breif and Agile Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007P5N8D4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
	- This book essentially repeats the concepts from Elements of Scrum. It would be handy to have a copy of it as a guide for the class. If don't have time to read Elements of Scrum, please at least flip through this book (it's much shorter).
