# Agile Intro Reading

## Assignment

1. Read the required reading
2. Start discussing what you just read in Slack. There is an #agile channel where you can discuss. Note down any burning questions you might have about the reading.

## Required Reading

**Due 1/7, Tuesday**

- [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X) [Chapter 1] (provided on Slack)
- [Elements of Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Scrum-Chris-Sims-ebook/dp/B004O0U74Q/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1546492282&sr=1-2&keywords=elements+of+scrum) [Part I]
- Read the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [agile principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Spend 30 minutes independently researching the Agile Manifesto principle that you have been assigned. Come to class ready to explain and discuss what that principle means in practice and in a software development concept. 

 **Due 1/8, Wednesday**
 - [Elements of Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Scrum-Chris-Sims-ebook/dp/B004O0U74Q/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1546492282&sr=1-2&keywords=elements+of+scrum) [Part II] 

## Additional Resources

A shorter alternative to "Elements of Scrum" (in case you run out of time)

- [Scrum: A Breathtakingly Breif and Agile Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007P5N8D4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
	- This book essentially repeats the concepts from Elements of Scrum. It would be handy to have a copy of it as a guide for the class. If don't have time to read Elements of Scrum, please at least flip through this book (it's much shorter).
