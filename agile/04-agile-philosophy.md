### An Agile J-Term
Split up into 4 teams:

- 5 minutes of research on your topic
- 10 minutes of discussion about how that might apply to the course
- share that with the rest of the class

Much of government traditionally operates in the waterfall style.

> Policy -->
> 
> Requirements Gathering/Design -->
> 
> Procurement/Contracts/etc -->
> 
> Development -->
> 
> Press release -->
> 
> Implementation

Some agencies are pushing for more agile development.
