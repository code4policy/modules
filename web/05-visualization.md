## Project Note

If you're planning to use D3 for the MVP of your project, you can find some great templates at


- http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock (Mike Bostock created D3JS, these are his examples)
- http://bl.ocks.org/ (same website, examples by different people)
- https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery
- http://christopheviau.com/d3list/gallery.html
- https://d3js.org/


Some of these pre-created D3 visualizations take in CSV format (like the simple example that we did above). Others take in a JSON format. We will be talking in class about converting between CSV and JSON formats using python. If you find that you want to use a data visualization, but are not sure how to connect the dataset to the visualization, have someone in your project group chat with me.

## Organizing your Code
