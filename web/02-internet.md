* Internet - a network of networks
* "World Wide Web" - a service built on top of the internet's infrastructure (other services include e-mail and IRC chat, neither of which use HTTP)

#### ❇️ Example

There are lots of programs that can resolve a domain name for you, one of those is [`dig` (domain information groper)](https://www.tecmint.com/10-linux-dig-domain-information-groper-commands-to-query-dns/).

```
dig google.com +short
```

#### ❇️ Example

Let's set up a custom domain!

1. In the GitHub repo, create a file called CNAME with the name of the domain
2. Set up the apex domain name to point to GitHub's servers in Namecheap:
	
	https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain
	
3. Check that the domain is correct using `dig`





## Routing

Data travels sent over the internet is chopped up and sent in packets. Here is [what an IP packet looks like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet#Example:_IP_packets). It has a **header** which contains the metadata and a **payload** which contains the data. Different protocols handle packets differently. For example, some protocols like those you might use to stream video will tolerate packet loss, other protocols like TCP/IP which is used to transmit websites don't).

Routers route those packets to their correct destinations based on the metadata the packet carries.

#### ❇️ Example

You can use traceroute to see how your request is routed to its destination.

```
traceroute google.com
```
