Thanks for taking the leap into code!

For those who plan to continue coding:

- Overcome barriers to learning coding
- Emphasize key skills for self-sufficiency:
	- like boldly diving into an unfamiliar codebase
	- like reading, not fearing, technical documentation
	- like reading (and googling) error messages
	- like knowing what to google and when
	- like knowing when and how to reach out for help
- Project-based learning as a way to pick up technical skills
- Learning how to deal with ambiguity
- Intro to a modern programmer's toolkit and a wide range of  tools
- Ability to dive deeper into the "why" on a technical question
- Skills for managing or working on tech teams

For everyone: 

- Understanding of agile culture and where it may be useful in service of the public
- Interfacing with coders with empathy and understanding
- Ability to "ask the right quesetions" when making desecisions pertaining to technolgy and not fearing technical detail.

## Course Evaluations

Course evaluations are accessible through the canvas and are open through **January 19**. Your honest feedback will be particularly important both in helping me understand how to best iterate on the course as well as helping the Kennedy School better understand the role of technical education in the curriculum. Please take some time to thoughtfully fill out the course evaluation.
