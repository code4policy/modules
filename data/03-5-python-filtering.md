# Data 3-5: Python - Filtering

We can use `for` loops and `if` statements to filter through data.

```python
rows = [
    {"name": "Rachel", "age": 34},
    {"name": "Monica", "age": 34},
    {"name": "Phoebe", "age": 37}
]

# filter to age < 37
millenials = []
for row in rows:
    if row['age'] < 37:
        millenials.append(row)

print(millenials)
```

```python
# filter whitelist names

cool_people = []
whitelist = ['Rachel', 'Phoebe']
for row in rows:
    if row['name'] in whitelist:
        cool_people.append(row)

print(cool_people)
```

```python
# filter blacklist names

cool_people = []
blacklist = ['Monica']
for row in rows:
    if row['name'] not in blacklist:
        cool_people.append(row)

print(cool_people)
```

If you use Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for data manipulation and analysis instead, the code would look like this: https://gist.github.com/AlJohri/59c9762845519f999eb28fe45276f4c1

### ➡️ Try It

1. Read `output/vegetables.csv` into a variable called `vegetables`.
2. Loop through `vegetables` and filter down to only green vegtables using a whitelist.
3. Print veggies to the terminal
4. Write the veggies to a json file called `output/greenveggies.json`

**Bonus:** 
Output another csv called `output/green_vegetables.csv`.
