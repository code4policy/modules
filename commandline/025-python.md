Lets create and run a very small python program

## ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) Example

1. Create and "assignments" folder, navigate to it, and create an empty file called `hello.py`

    ```
    cd ~/Development
    mkdir assignments
    cd assignmets
    touch hello.py
    ```

2. Put this simple python program into hello.py

    ```python
    print("Hello, im a python program")
    ```

3. Run `hello.py`

    ```bash
    python3 hello.py
    ```

## ➡️ Try It

1. In your assignments folder, create a new python program called "aplusb.py"

    ```
    a = 5
    b = 7
    print("The sum of a and b is" + str(a + b))
    ```
