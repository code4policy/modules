# LOST?

If you find yourself staring blankly at the terminal unsure what to do next, start with the following:

## Where am I?

**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory 

```
pwd
```

## What is here?

**l**i**s**t files and folders

```
ls
```

## Where do I need to go?

**c**hange **d**irectory

```
cd ~/path/to/folder
```  

Remember, you can use an absolute path or a relative path.

If you use an **absolute path**, it will start with `~` or `/`

- `~` is your home directory (`~` is shorthand for something like `/Users/mehtad`)
- `/` is the root of your file system

If you use a **relative path**., it may start with `./` or `../`


- `.` is the folder you're currently in
- `..` is the parent of the folder you're currently in
