# Final Project Agile

The final project will take place in two sprints

**Sprint 1 - MVP**

First week of class + weekend (roughly)

**Sprint 2 - Submission**

Second week of class + weekend (roughly)


## Requirements

For each sprint I expect teams to submit

1. A task board (on GitHub) conatining
	*  a list of user stories you have committed to for the sprint that have a checklist for INVEST and one or more definiions of done
	*  cards with tasks for each user story that each have estimated values

2. Documentation for your daily scrum meeting
	* When did you have it?
	* Was it in person, on skype, or on slack?
	* Daily burndown - at the end of the meeting, document how many points completed since the start of the sprint and how many points remain

3. Documentation for your retrospective
	* Each team member will submit
		* one thing that worked well
		* one thing that didn't work well that the team ought to change for the next sprint.
